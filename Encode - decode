		- Encode base64: echo -n 'texttoencode' | base64
		  Decode base64: echo 'texttodecodeâ€™ | base64 -d
		- Encode md5: echo -n 'texttoencode' | md5sum
		  Decode md5: need to use external tools
		
	Optionally we can use the BurpSuite tool wich has a Decode utility.
	And we can use online tools like https://md5hashing.net/hash in wich we can encode/decode with many algorithms.
